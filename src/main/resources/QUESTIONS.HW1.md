## HOMEWORK 1 QUESTIONS

### (Q1) Adding Additional Animals

Add the following animals to the animal.kingdom.animals package

The animals will extend a class in thier category and implements the interface that describes thier behavior

For example Flamingo will extend the Bird class and implement the Swimmer, Runner and Flyer interfaces.

* Aligator (A Reptile that can Run and Swim)
* Flamingo (A Bird that can Swim, Run, and Fly)
* Zebra (A Mammal that can Run and Swim)
* CockRoach (An insect that can Fly)
* Salmon (A Fish can can Swim)
* Penguin (A Mammal that can Swim)
* Bat (A Mammal that can Fly)
* HoneyBee (An insect that can Fly)

You can follow other examples in the animal.kingdom.animals package.

Pay attention to how the classes must implement methods from the Interfaces.

For interfaces that require getters and setters, make sure that the properties are created in the classes.

### (Q2) Creating Instances of Animals

Following the example in the class animal.kingdom.stage.AflacOnStage

Create a class called Question2Stage in the animal.kingdom.stage package for all classes created in Q1 and:

Inside the main() function of this class

* Print out the return value of the run() method for all classes that implement the Runner interface.
* Print out the return value of the swim() method for all classes that implement the Swimmer interface.
* Print out the return value of the fly() method for all classes that implement the Flyer interface.

Run the class as a Java application to see the results.
